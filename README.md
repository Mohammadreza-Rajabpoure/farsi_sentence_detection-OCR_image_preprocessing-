# farsi_sentence_detection-OCR_image_preprocessing-
In this project we try to detect  sentences from images with the background of the iranian driver's license card.

each input data is an image included about 38 to 40 farsi sentences with Bnazanin or Byekan fonts.
the outputs are images of sentences that crop from the original image and stored in a folder named 'storeg'.
frist each paragraf detected from right to left then sentences are detected from top to bottom in each paragraf.
